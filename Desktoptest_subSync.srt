I didn't tip it over.
I kept feeding it in there.

45
23:47:06,878 --> 23:47:08,711
And then finally when it did,
the spring released,

46
23:47:08,736 --> 23:47:10,032
and then the Doritos just got stuck

47
23:47:10,057 --> 23:47:10,953

48
23:47:10,978 --> 23:47:12,858

close to makin' a bust.

about going back on the force?

No. It's just...
it's one day like jury duty.

to have a catch with you.

at the unemployment office?

Well, actually, I can't get unemployment

82
23:48:26,947 --> 23:48:29,429
because I've never had a job,
so in <i>your</i> face.

He's dressed nice for a meeting, Dad.

84
23:48:34,681 --> 23:48:36,071
This tech start-up wants to recruit him,

85
23:48:36,096 --> 23:48:37,903
and it would be an amazing opportunity.

86

and make great money.

gotta be the right fit.

- Sure. And, Chale, sweetie,

I think what Kendra's
trying to say for all of us

91
23:48:48,426 --> 23:48:50,242
is you make it fit.

92
23:48:51,168 --> 23:48:54,620
Even if you gotta force it,
you just jam it in there. Yeah.

93

warm up the hands.

up by a dead body.

101
23:49:13,979 --> 23:49:15,838
So what's the deal?

102
23:49:15,863 --> 23:49:17,121
All we gotta do is find the location

103
23:49:17,146 --> 23:49:19,215
of where the deal's going
down and we're good.

104
23:49:19,240 --> 23:49:21,073
Let Cellucci take the lead.

105
23:49:21,098 --> 23:49:22,528
Cellucci?

106
23:49:22,553 --> 23:49:24,512
You didn't tell me
Cellucci's on this case.

107
23:49:24,537 --> 23:49:25,937

23:49:27,545 --> 23:49:28,794

a guard shack window

111
23:49:30,209 --> 23:49:31,848

112
23:49:31,873 --> 23:49:33,939
Yeah, it's his screensaver.

113

traded you in for a new model.

- Oh, no.
- [Laughs]

120

and you don't cash it in

124

- 'cause it ain't worth it.
- Oh, yeah.

125

- Not really.

23:50:22,595 --> 23:50:24,735
Anyway,
you guys doing any business in the area?

128
23:50:24,760 --> 23:50:26,563
We have some potential buyers lined up.

129
23:50:26,588 --> 23:50:28,384
Yeah, which is why we were
thinking that maybe...

Domingo, I'm sorry. What is that?

131
23:50:30,965 --> 23:50:32,836
I see the two patties,
but what's in between there?

132
23:50:32,861 --> 23:50:33,861
Is that cheese or an egg?

133
23:50:33,886 --> 23:50:35,720
Both. With two hash browns on top.

134

- Yeah.</i>

135
23:50:37,892 --> 23:50:40,298
Um, sweetheart.
Domingo was about to tell us...

136
23:50:40,323 --> 23:50:42,845
Now was that a special
order or did you just...

137
23:50:42,870 --> 23:50:44,891
Did you order that off the menu?

138
23:50:44,916 --> 23:50:46,610
It's the breakfast burger.
It's on the second page.

139
23:50:46,635 --> 23:50:48,111
And the egg doesn't drip on your hands?

140
23:50:48,136 --> 23:50:50,069
Nope, hash brown soaks it right up.

141
23:50:50,138 --> 23:50:51,416
- Wow, that's thought out.
- Okay, all right.

142
23:50:51,441 --> 23:50:52,878
- It's thought out.
- Okay.

143
23:50:53,117 --> 23:50:54,817
Are we done with the burger talk?
Yes, sorry.

144
23:50:54,842 --> 23:50:55,904
Are we done? Okay.

145
23:50:55,929 --> 23:50:58,188
So I'm sorry, please. Continue.

146
23:50:58,213 --> 23:50:59,599
Uh, no problem. Actually, this week...

147
23:50:59,624 --> 23:51:01,098
I'm sorry.
I gotta stop... I gotta stop this.

You know what it is? I just...

it's not workin'.

You know, I'm gonna start Monday.

152

I'll start Monday.
Hey, waitress? Can I get...

153
23:51:09,691 --> 23:51:10,724
- Honey, honey, honey, honey.
- Huh?

154
23:51:10,749 --> 23:51:12,849
You keep interrupting people,
and they're trying to tell us

155
23:51:12,874 --> 23:51:13,997
where they're going for the weekend.

156
23:51:14,022 --> 23:51:16,222
And I wanna hear all about it,
but I will hear much better

157

with the breakfast burger.

158
23:51:17,764 --> 23:51:20,115
Two meals, one bun. I'll be locked on.

159
23:51:20,752 --> 23:51:22,302
Okay, excuse me, waitress.

160
23:51:22,327 --> 23:51:24,441
Could you fly in one of
these for my husband?

161
23:51:24,466 --> 23:51:27,543
I'll pay you a million dollars.
Thanks so much. Okay. Sorry.

162
23:51:27,568 --> 23:51:29,152
I like this guy.
You know what it is about him?

163
23:51:29,177 --> 23:51:30,271
He's got an appetite for life.

164
23:51:30,296 --> 23:51:32,598
Yes, life. That's what he's been eating.

165
23:51:34,615 --> 23:51:37,223
So, you were saying where you
were going for the weekend.

166
23:51:37,248 --> 23:51:39,348
Yeah, Boston. We're having
a big art show this weekend.

167
23:51:39,373 --> 23:51:40,146
Oh, Boston.

168
23:51:40,171 --> 23:51:41,707
It's gonna be kind of nice.
I thought maybe...

[Cellphone chiming]

170

Oh. Give me one second.

172
23:51:48,353 --> 23:51:49,833
What is it?

173
23:51:50,368 --> 23:51:52,425
I thought you told me it was handled.

174
23:51:53,986 --> 23:51:56,482
I'm sorry. We gotta run. It's business.

175

- No, no. Don't worry.

23:51:58,911 --> 23:52:00,380
- But I'll see you guys soon.
- Okay.

177
23:52:00,405 --> 23:52:01,567
- Yes, you got it.
- All right, bye.

178
23:52:01,592 --> 23:52:05,286
- All right.
- What is the matter with you?

179
23:52:06,183 --> 23:52:07,731
What?

180
23:52:08,081 --> 23:52:09,677
I am try...

181
23:52:09,702 --> 23:52:11,968
I'm gonna eat around the bite marks.

182
23:52:11,993 --> 23:52:16,542
No! I am trying to get information,

183
23:52:16,567 --> 23:52:18,935
and you are yapping about your burger!

184
23:52:18,960 --> 23:52:20,630
I'm trying to make things look natural.

185
23:52:20,655 --> 23:52:22,107
- It's called police work.
- [Scoffs]

186
23:52:22,132 --> 23:52:23,099
And what about you?

187
23:52:23,124 --> 23:52:25,599
"Hey, can you tell us where
your crime is going down?

188
23:52:26,325 --> 23:52:28,856
"And if you wouldn't mind,
speak into the tiny microphone

189
23:52:28,881 --> 23:52:31,317
in my blouse. That'd
be super. I like it."

190
23:52:34,458 --> 23:52:36,231
Come on.

191
23:52:39,753 --> 23:52:42,169
- You got problems, you know that?
- Oh, I got problems?

192
23:52:42,194 --> 23:52:43,994
Yeah. [Under breath] I told
you this was a bad idea.

193
23:52:44,018 --> 23:52:45,903
It's a very good idea.
I got us the information we need.

194
23:52:45,936 --> 23:52:46,374
All right,

195
23:52:46,399 --> 23:52:47,325
- you have your own mic, stupid!
- Boston.

196
23:52:47,350 --> 23:52:48,434
- It's Boston.
- Get over.

197
23:52:49,654 --> 23:52:51,418
You know what else I got?

198
23:52:51,443 --> 23:52:53,569
I got two burgers, I got a vanilla malt,

199
23:52:53,594 --> 23:52:54,957
and a salad for my wife.

200
23:52:54,982 --> 23:52:56,786
By the way,
we got a pretty big tab out here,

201
23:52:56,811 --> 23:52:59,114
so if you can run out a debit card.

202
23:53:01,109 --> 23:53:03,259
I scoped out your rezzie,
checked some refs,

203
23:53:03,284 --> 23:53:04,889
noodled around on your app submish,

204
23:53:04,914 --> 23:53:06,803
and I'm just gonna
come out and say it...

205
23:53:06,920 --> 23:53:09,061
I want you here at Nozzler.

206
23:53:09,086 --> 23:53:12,811
Uh, I appreciate that, Parker, but, uh,

207
23:53:12,907 --> 23:53:15,793
- I am an entrepreneur myself...
- [Thud]

208
23:53:15,818 --> 23:53:19,115
and I'm not sure that
I would be comfortable

209
23:53:19,140 --> 23:53:21,748
being a spoke in a wheel.

210
23:53:21,823 --> 23:53:24,240
My dream is to be the wheel.

211
23:53:24,265 --> 23:53:25,732
Hear it, respect it.

212
23:53:25,757 --> 23:53:26,850
In fact, you know who
said the same thing

213
23:53:26,875 --> 23:53:28,341
about six months ago?

214
23:53:29,767 --> 23:53:32,269
Little dreamer named Parker Cohen. Yeah.

215
23:53:32,294 --> 23:53:34,225
And now I'm about to
take this baby public.

216
23:53:34,250 --> 23:53:35,896
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

217
23:53:35,921 --> 23:53:37,975
Yeah.
And that's when we decide to break open

218
23:53:38,000 --> 23:53:39,592
this 50-year-old bottle of scotch.

219
23:53:39,617 --> 23:53:41,512
I don't wanna tell you how much
I paid for it, but I'm gonna.

220
23:53:41,537 --> 23:53:42,717
$27,000.

221
23:53:42,742 --> 23:53:45,126
- Oh, wow.
- That is a lot of money.

222
23:53:45,151 --> 23:53:46,450
Yes, it is.

223
23:53:46,475 --> 23:53:48,115
So here's the offer.

224
23:53:48,140 --> 23:53:50,874
Six figs, stock options,
piece of everything we develop,

225
23:53:50,899 --> 23:53:52,443
plus...

226
23:53:52,468 --> 23:53:54,756
we rent out Six Flags
for our company retreat.

227
23:53:54,781 --> 23:53:56,448
[Exhales]

228
23:53:56,473 --> 23:53:58,482
I do love the log flume.

229
23:53:59,080 --> 23:54:02,787
And here,
a little cinnamon on your breadstick.

230
23:54:03,203 --> 23:54:05,370
A signing bonus.

231
23:54:06,626 --> 23:54:08,404
$10,000?

232
23:54:08,429 --> 23:54:10,096
What do you say, Chale?

233
23:54:10,220 --> 23:54:11,702
Wanna flume to the moon?

234
23:54:16,150 --> 23:54:18,256
Hey, you know where my socks are?

235
23:54:18,540 --> 23:54:20,092
Wow.

236
23:54:20,117 --> 23:54:22,084
That is quite the statement.

237
23:54:23,912 --> 23:54:25,775
Yeah, where, uh, where are my Met socks?

238
23:54:25,800 --> 23:54:26,943
I need 'em for Fantasy Camp.

239
23:54:26,968 --> 23:54:28,709
Why can't you just wear
the socks you have on?

240
23:54:28,734 --> 23:54:29,780
That's a great idea.

241
23:54:29,805 --> 23:54:30,943
So when they divide up teams down there,

242
23:54:30,968 --> 23:54:32,803
they'll be like, "Okay,
uh, we'll take the dude"

243
23:54:32,828 --> 23:54:33,967
"with the eye patch.

244
23:54:33,992 --> 23:54:36,967
You can have the sad guy
with the regular socks."

245
23:54:38,937 --> 23:54:40,571
That's cute that you think socks

246
23:54:40,596 --> 23:54:42,811
are the reason you get picked last.

247
23:54:43,367 --> 23:54:45,833
I've worked for 20
years for this moment.

248
23:54:45,858 --> 23:54:47,498
- I wanna look the part.
- And you will,

249
23:54:47,523 --> 23:54:49,662
but I need your opinion
on something first, okay?

250
23:54:49,687 --> 23:54:50,678
- All right.
- Okay.

251
23:54:50,703 --> 23:54:51,936
Pick my brain.

252
23:54:52,160 --> 23:54:53,913
So I'm about to get
this promotion at work.

253
23:54:53,938 --> 23:54:54,436
Uh-huh.

254
23:54:54,461 --> 23:54:56,347
I know it. Everybody knows it.

255
23:54:56,372 --> 23:54:57,482
But when they make the announcement,

256
23:54:57,507 --> 23:55:00,631
I wanna, like, look surprised
and then humble, you know?

257
23:55:00,656 --> 23:55:02,162
I've been working on it in the mirror.

258
23:55:02,187 --> 23:55:04,131
So just tell me what
you think, all right?

259
23:55:04,156 --> 23:55:05,955
Tell me I got the promotion.

260
23:55:05,980 --> 23:55:08,789
"And the new... whatever the thing is

261
23:55:08,814 --> 23:55:12,623
goes to... Donna Gable."

262
23:55:12,648 --> 23:55:14,514
[Gasps] Wha...

263
23:55:14,539 --> 23:55:16,172
Oh, my G...

264
23:55:16,197 --> 23:55:19,396
- [Gasps] Oh.
- Okay.

265
23:55:19,421 --> 23:55:21,116
Really?

266
23:55:21,141 --> 23:55:22,646
Okay.

267
23:55:24,820 --> 23:55:27,088
You gotta... you gotta
take it down a notch.

268
23:55:27,113 --> 23:55:27,795
Really?

269
23:55:27,820 --> 23:55:28,732
Your eyebrows, they're everything...

270
23:55:28,757 --> 23:55:30,014
They're all over the place.

271
23:55:30,039 --> 23:55:32,071
Okay, but I can't just
stand there like an idiot.

272
23:55:32,096 --> 23:55:33,271
I gotta do something.

273
23:55:33,296 --> 23:55:35,295
Just do what I do. I go from double guns

274
23:55:35,335 --> 23:55:37,154
into prayer hands under the chin.

275
23:55:37,179 --> 23:55:39,752
I do a face bow out into a point.

276
23:55:39,777 --> 23:55:41,232
What's up?

277
23:55:41,257 --> 23:55:42,467
I like that.

278
23:55:42,492 --> 23:55:44,456
Yeah, whatever. Where
are my socks? Come on.

279
23:55:44,481 --> 23:55:45,960
- Ooh, on top of the dryer.
- Oh. Great, thanks.

280
23:55:45,985 --> 23:55:47,350
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah.

281
23:55:47,375 --> 23:55:49,275
[Clicks tongue]

282
23:55:50,764 --> 23:55:52,096
Hmm?

283
23:55:52,121 --> 23:55:53,621
Mm.

284
23:55:58,058 --> 23:56:00,092
[Door closes]

285
23:56:00,117 --> 23:56:01,450
Hey!

286
23:56:01,475 --> 23:56:03,421
Okay, so...

287
23:56:03,791 --> 23:56:05,226
Not a good fit.

288
23:56:05,251 --> 23:56:07,425
Oh. Well, that's okay.

289
23:56:07,450 --> 23:56:09,882
- It was a great fit!
- [Laughs]

290
23:56:09,907 --> 23:56:11,296
Do you see that? What I did there?

291
23:56:11,321 --> 23:56:11,867
Yeah.

292
23:56:11,892 --> 23:56:15,280
Okay. Stock options, a 6-figure salary,

293
23:56:15,305 --> 23:56:20,225
and a signing bonus for $10,000.

294
23:56:20,250 --> 23:56:22,921
- That is unbelievable.
- Right?!

295
23:56:22,946 --> 23:56:25,319
- Mwah!
- Wow. Okay.

296
23:56:25,344 --> 23:56:28,706
So this is amazing,
because I have news, too.

297
23:56:28,731 --> 23:56:29,616
[Chuckles]

298
23:56:29,641 --> 23:56:33,186
I got accepted to my dream school,
Columbia Law.

299
23:56:33,211 --> 23:56:35,514
What?! That's fantastic!

300
23:56:35,539 --> 23:56:37,578
It's way too expensive,
but it is really cool to know

301
23:56:37,603 --> 23:56:38,592
that I got accepted.

302
23:56:38,617 --> 23:56:40,963
No, no. Look, when Nozzler goes public,

303
23:56:40,988 --> 23:56:42,621
money is no longer an issue.

304
23:56:42,646 --> 23:56:45,363
We'll... and this is
gonna be the best part.

305
23:56:45,388 --> 23:56:48,652
Seeing your father's face when
I give him this rent check.

306
23:56:48,677 --> 23:56:50,417
Grab your phone. This is gonna be epic.

307
23:56:50,442 --> 23:56:53,676
Yes! Donna, I got 'em! Awesome!

308
23:56:53,701 --> 23:56:56,683
Mr. Gable, I present to you a rent check

309
23:56:56,708 --> 23:56:58,721
for six months paid in full.

310
23:56:58,746 --> 23:57:00,983
Thank you very much.

311
23:57:11,038 --> 23:57:12,747
- To Fantasy Camp, huh?
- Yeah.

312
23:57:12,772 --> 23:57:13,756
- Come on.
- Fantasy camp, baby.

313
23:57:13,781 --> 23:57:16,181
- Whoo!
- Going to Mets Camp, are ya?

314
23:57:16,309 --> 23:57:17,966
That's always been a dream of mine.

315
23:57:17,991 --> 23:57:19,405
You know, I played Minor League ball.

316
23:57:19,430 --> 23:57:20,546
I had no idea.

317
23:57:20,571 --> 23:57:22,303
Yeah, yeah.
If you ever showed a little interest

318
23:57:22,328 --> 23:57:24,757
in my personal life,
I probably would've told ya.

319
23:57:25,060 --> 23:57:28,137
Uh, well, hey, have a great trip.

320
23:57:29,600 --> 23:57:31,567
- Hey, Enzo.
- Yeah?

321
23:57:31,592 --> 23:57:33,057
Wait a second.

322
23:57:33,518 --> 23:57:35,418
This was supposed to
have meatball on it.

323
23:57:35,443 --> 23:57:37,358
I just want to make sure.

324
23:57:37,618 --> 23:57:40,219
Yeah, whatever.
You know what I'm talkin' about.

325
23:57:41,483 --> 23:57:44,498
Whoa! Cellucci.

326
23:57:44,551 --> 23:57:46,622
- What are you doing here?
- We gotta see Domingo again.

327
23:57:46,647 --> 23:57:49,639
- What?
- Yes, at his apartment right now.

328
23:57:49,664 --> 23:57:51,639
No, I can't.
We're going to Mets Fantasy Camp.

329
23:57:51,664 --> 23:57:55,006
Oh, now you're just
twisting the knife now.

330
23:57:55,197 --> 23:57:57,806
No, tonight we got the
"Good 'N Plenty Barbecue"

331
23:57:57,831 --> 23:58:00,475
with Doc Gooden and then we
got drinks on the piazza.

332
23:58:00,500 --> 23:58:02,502
Let me guess... With Mike Piazza?

333
23:58:02,527 --> 23:58:03,843
No, Tim Teufel.

334
23:58:04,137 --> 23:58:06,585
Look, this case is on the 1 yard line.

335
23:58:06,610 --> 23:58:08,648
I just need you for one hour. Tops.

336
23:58:08,673 --> 23:58:10,860
One hour, all right?
I'll meet you guys at JFK.

337
23:58:10,885 --> 23:58:13,139
Kyle, grab my luggage.

338
23:58:15,107 --> 23:58:16,767
Hey.

339
23:58:16,988 --> 23:58:18,685
The massage is almost over.

340
23:58:18,710 --> 23:58:20,391
Stella just has to crack my feet.

341
23:58:20,416 --> 23:58:21,782
Gonna be a few minutes.

342
23:58:21,807 --> 23:58:23,240
No problem, Domingo.

343
23:58:23,265 --> 23:58:26,048
If you don't care of
your feet, who will?

344
23:58:26,323 --> 23:58:28,290
- I love my feet.
- [Laughs]

345
23:58:28,315 --> 23:58:29,967
- I'll be back.
- Yeah, good to know.

346
23:58:29,992 --> 23:58:31,532
I like your feet.

347
23:58:31,642 --> 23:58:33,471
[Lowered voice] What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

348
23:58:33,496 --> 23:58:34,650
I got a flight to catch in an hour.

349
23:58:34,675 --> 23:58:35,968
[Lowered voice] Okay. I'm sorry.

350
23:58:36,000 --> 23:58:37,440
Why don't I just waltz in there

351
23:58:37,465 --> 23:58:39,025
and tell a half-naked crime lord,

352
23:58:39,050 --> 23:58:42,431
"Uh, my fake husband has to
get on a plane to Florida

353
23:58:42,456 --> 23:58:44,446
to play grab-ass with
his stupid friends!"?

354
23:58:44,471 --> 23:58:46,343
And some retired Mets.
There's a lot of people down there.

355
23:58:46,368 --> 23:58:48,595
It's big event. It's a big event.

356
23:58:48,620 --> 23:58:49,837
You're unbelievable, you know that?

357
23:58:49,862 --> 23:58:51,790
You worm your way into my case
and now you wanna tell me,

358
23:58:51,815 --> 23:58:52,860
- you wanna tell me...
- Whoa, wait a second.

359
23:58:52,885 --> 23:58:54,329
- Wait a second. <i>Your</i> case?
- Yeah.

360
23:58:54,354 --> 23:58:56,308
Okay... this is my case!

361
23:58:56,333 --> 23:58:58,384
[Scoffs] I didn't worm
my way into anything.

362
23:58:58,409 --> 23:59:00,809
Believe me,
they called me in here because <i>someone</i>

363
23:59:00,834 --> 23:59:03,196
was droppin' the ball. Oh, yeah. You.

364
23:59:03,221 --> 23:59:04,782
- Wow.
- Don't...

365
23:59:04,807 --> 23:59:06,516
- Wow.
- No, no, no, don't you do it.

366
23:59:06,541 --> 23:59:08,041
- Don't "wow"?
- Yeah, don't do... You don't "wow" me.

367
23:59:08,066 --> 23:59:09,048
- Wow.
- You don't "wow" me.

368
23:59:09,073 --> 23:59:10,610
- Wow.
- I "wow" you. I "wow"...

369
23:59:10,635 --> 23:59:11,814
- Oh, you "wow" me?
- Yeah, yeah, I "wow" you.

370
23:59:11,839 --> 23:59:13,196
You "wow" me? Well, listen!

371
23:59:13,221 --> 23:59:15,673
I am <i>this close to solving this case.</i>

372
23:59:15,698 --> 23:59:17,131
Don't screw it up.

373
23:59:17,156 --> 23:59:18,641
Okay, okay,
can you lower your voice, please?

374
23:59:18,666 --> 23:59:20,098
'Cause it is booming!

375
23:59:20,123 --> 23:59:22,157
Shut... up!

376
23:59:22,182 --> 23:59:24,376
The place could be bugged.

377
23:59:25,505 --> 23:59:26,977
[Sighs]

378
23:59:28,692 --> 23:59:30,235
No, look around, dummy.

379
23:59:30,260 --> 23:59:31,361
I am looking. Look with your eyes!

380
23:59:31,386 --> 23:59:31,717
Oh!

381
23:59:31,742 --> 23:59:34,415
- That's how you look.
- Shut up!

382
23:59:36,123 --> 23:59:37,490
Hey, I got it.

383
23:59:38,469 --> 23:59:41,087
- The giraffe.
- Okay...

384
23:59:42,325 --> 23:59:44,641
You don't say "giraffe."

385
23:59:44,824 --> 23:59:47,165
You point to the
giraffe. You point to it.

386
23:59:47,190 --> 23:59:49,190
- You just said it twice.
- Oh, my God! Just...

387
23:59:49,215 --> 23:59:50,725
Check the stupid giraffe.

388
23:59:50,750 --> 23:59:51,861
You said... That's
three times right there.

389
23:59:51,886 --> 23:59:52,316
Okay, okay!

390
23:59:52,341 --> 23:59:54,610
Fine! [Mutters]

391
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,867
Crap!

392
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:07,786
- Hey.
- Hey.

393
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:09,244
When did we get there?

394
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:12,734
Oh, it's just a little
thing I picked up yesterday.

395
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,071
I know you enjoy the
occasional cappuccino

396
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:16,345
to put a little pep in your step.

397
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,447
Oh, Chale, you shouldn't have.
Those things are so expensive.

398
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,649
But since you did,
let's put some cinnamon

399
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,775
- in this mamma jamma, huh?
- [Chuckles]

400
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,067
Um, hey, babe.

401
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,970
Did you buy this for me?

402
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:33,235
Oh, uh, I'm not really good with purses.
Is that a good one?

403
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,938
Um, that's a Coach bag.
That's like 400 bucks.

404
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,681
Eh... Mm.

405
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,405
What?

406
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,884
Wow. I've been married 20 years

407
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:46,884
and I'm walking around with
an <i>Assistant</i> Coach bag.

408
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:49,793
Ah. I'm not familiar with that brand.

409
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:53,056
Kevin got it for me at the
Tri County Flea Market.

410
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:57,337
Um, he got that and my
<i>Alvin Klein</i> luggage.

411
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:02,282
Whoa. Wait, babe, there's $200 in here.

412
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:03,634
Huh?

413
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,720
Eh, I just wanted you
to have a good day.

414
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:07,384
- [Chuckles]
- [Gasps]

415
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,947
I feel like a mob wife.

416
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,813
In a good way.

417
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,516
Oh, Chale, you might wanna
pump the brakes a little bit.

418
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,142
Look, I'm just trying to show everyone

419
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,716
how much I appreciate them.

420
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:19,841
It's not... oh. I almost forgot.

421
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,332
Jackie!

422
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:25,308
- Yeah?
- Here's a few slices of cheddar

423
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,564
for you to get that video game.

424
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,649
I am diggin' rich Chale!

425
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,540
[Chale chuckles]

426
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:34,118
In this house, money buys affection.

427
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:37,024
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

428
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:38,986
What the hell did you do?

429
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:40,384
I barely touched it, all right?

430
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,314
- It was halfway falling off already.
- Well, then fix it!

431
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,704
Okay, let me just get out my
ceramic giraffe repair kit.

432
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:47,316
I need something sticky.

433
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,477
Give me some gum. Give me some gum.

434
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:49,779
I don't even think I have any.

435
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:50,915
Oh, please. You're from Massapequa.

436
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,360
Your name's Vanessa
Cellucci. You got gum.

437
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:56,407
Come on. Hurry up.

438
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:01,306
[Chewing rapidly]

439
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:11,887
What flavor is this?

440
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,523
[Mouth full] Passion bubble.

441
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,619
- Passion bubble? What are you, 12?
- [Groans]

442
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:17,727
Domingo: Be right out, guys!
Just putting on pants.

443
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:18,759
Oh, no rush!

444
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:20,584
- [Lowered voice] Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

445
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:24,384
Okay, give me...

446
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:25,982
Not enough. Give me
some more. Give me more.

447
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,533
It's not sticky enough. Come on.

448
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:29,570
Okay, just give me your gum.
Give me... oh, it's so gross.

449
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,816
- Oh, it's like a river in there.
- All right, shut up!

450
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:35,798
- Hey.
- Thank you so much for waiting.

451
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,298
[Singsongy] Who wants drinks?

452
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,540
Oh, you know what? I think we're good,

453
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,665
because we're in a bit of a time crunch,
so...

454
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,322
All right, well, let's get into it.

455
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:46,462
This weekend is our
biggest art show in Boston.

456
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:48,704
We thought maybe we could
do some business there.

457
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:50,743
We would... We would love that.

458
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:53,556
Perfect. So it's settled.
You're coming tomorrow. Boston.

459
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,485
Oh, snag. No, no, I mean, I
can't make it this weekend,

460
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,767
- but I think you can, right, hon?
- Yes, I can.

461
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,274
Oh, there you go. It's gonna be great.

462
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,199
And Boston's such an
awesome town, right?

463
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,681
[Boston accent] "Hey, Tommy,
did you touch Bobby's lobster?"

464
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,873
"I did not touch Bobby's lobster.

465
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:09,524
Bobby touched his own lobster."

466
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,015
[Laughs]

467
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
[Normal voice] It's a great city.

468
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,923
No, no, we'll all go together.
We'll make it a couples weekend.

469
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:16,962
Yes!

470
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,283
Oh, you know, I'd love to, Domingo.

471
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:21,274
But I gotta throw you a "no can do."

472
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,299
Uh, honey. [Chuckles]

473
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:26,759
I think the... the doctor can
look at that rash anytime.

474
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,509
Mm. That's not true,
because I called them

475
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:30,720
and they wouldn't move my appointment.

476
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:31,117
Mm.

477
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,095
And it's pretty irritating.

478
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,642
- Yeah, he can move the appointment.
- He can't.

479
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,056
- He'll be there.
- I'm not gonna be there

480
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:36,963
- He'll be there.
- So I'm not gonna make it.

481
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,105
- He's gonna be there.
- Sorry, I'm not gonna make it.

482
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,696
Sorry. I can't do it. Nope.

483
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,135
Not having you both there would
be a major disappointment.

484
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,104
You know what?

485
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:46,604
Maybe this isn't the right fit.

486
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:50,515
All right, you know what?

487
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,276
You won this, my little care bear.

488
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,948
You won this one.

489
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,141
She kicked the table. I saw her...

490
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,965
Why would you do that?

491
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,862
[Cellphone rings]

492
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,251
Oh, come on. Don't do this to me.

493
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:10,946
I don't wanna know what's
going on down there.

494
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,674
<i>Drinking beers with Mookie Wilson!</i>

495
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,432
<i>Mookie! Ahh! [Laughing]</i>

496
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,385
Oh, come on. That should be me!

497
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,676
<i>Hey, if it makes you feel any better,</i>

498
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,253
<i>I'm having a hell of a time. Enzo!</i>

499
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,253
- <i>Enzo!</i>
- Enzo's down there?!

500
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,288
<i>I taught Mike Piazza
how to make a calzone.</i>

501
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:25,862
<i>Tomorrow,
he's treating us all to spray tans.</i>

502
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:29,354
<i>- Except me. [Laughs]
- [Laughter]</i>

503
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,611
- Hey, babe. How you doin'?
- I'm missing everything.

504
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,987
Oh, yeah. But on the bright side,

505
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,932
you get to spend a night in Boston.

506
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:41,257
You could do your whole...

507
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,924
[Boston accent]
"Did you touch Tommy's lobster?" bit.

508
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:48,417
I already did it at
Domingo's. It crushed.

509
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,609
I got nothing to look forward to.

510
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,083
I tell you what I'm doing.
I'm going to Wahlburgers.

511
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:53,651
That's what's happening.

512
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:58,009
Hey, you know,
it's obvious that they need you

513
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,305
to solve this case.

514
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,636
Okay, that's not true.

515
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,532
Why else would they pull
a guy out of retirement

516
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,315
unless he's essential?

517
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,807
You know...

518
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:09,479
You know, I do...

519
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:12,505
I have abilities that a lot
of the other guys, they...

520
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,878
They just don't have, and...

521
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,721
He's useless.

522
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,518
I'm actually the centerpiece
of this whole case.

523
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,409
Maybe we'll get lucky and
he'll get food poisoning.

524
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,924
Hey, maybe I'll even win a medal.

525
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,556
Some kind of like civilian
thing for coming in

526
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,024
at the last minute there.

527
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,225
Yeah, and you know what?
You would deserve it.

528
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,815
He is such a moron.

529
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:40,698
Donna, you married a good man.

530
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:46,184
Sometimes I lose sight of that.
Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,073
Mm. Ahh.
