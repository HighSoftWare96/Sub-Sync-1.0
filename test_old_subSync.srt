Were you trying to steal candy

39

Honey, you tipped it over.

44
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,369
I didn't tip it over.
I kept feeding it in there.

45
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,227
And then finally when it did,
the spring released,

46
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:02,548
and then the Doritos just got stuck

47
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:03,469
and they were hanging there.

48
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,374

- I don't... Okay.

close to makin' a bust.

that counterfeit art?

to bark one more time.

about going back on the force?

No. It's just...
it's one day like jury duty.

to have a catch with you.

he's faking it or not.

at the unemployment office?

81

Well, actually, I can't get unemployment

82
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,945
because I've never had a job,
so in <i>your</i> face.

He's dressed nice for a meeting, Dad.

84
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,587
This tech start-up wants to recruit him,

85
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:30,419
and it would be an amazing opportunity.

86

and make great money.

I don't know if I'm taking it just yet.

gotta be the right fit.

- Mm-hmm.
- Sure. And, Chale, sweetie,

90

I think what Kendra's
trying to say for all of us

91
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:42,758
is you make it fit.

92
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:47,136
Even if you gotta force it,
you just jam it in there. Yeah.

93

warm up the hands.

up by a dead body.

101
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,354
So what's the deal?

102
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:09,637
All we gotta do is find the location

103
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,731
of where the deal's going
down and we're good.

104
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,589
Let Cellucci take the lead.

105
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,044
Cellucci?

106
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,028
You didn't tell me
Cellucci's on this case.

107
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,453

00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,310

a guard shack window

111
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,364

112
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,455
Yeah, it's his screensaver.

113

traded you in for a new model.

- Oh, no.
- [Laughs]

120

and you don't cash it in

124
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:10,674
- 'cause it ain't worth it.
- Oh, yeah.

125

- Not really.

00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,251
Anyway,
you guys doing any business in the area?

128
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:19,079
We have some potential buyers lined up.

129
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,900
Yeah, which is why we were
thinking that maybe...

130

Domingo, I'm sorry. What is that?

131
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,352
I see the two patties,
but what's in between there?

132
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,377
Is that cheese or an egg?

133
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,236
Both. With two hash browns on top.

134
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,939

- Yeah.</i>

135
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,814
Um, sweetheart.
Domingo was about to tell us...

136
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,361
Now was that a special
order or did you just...

137
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:37,407
Did you order that off the menu?

138
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:39,126
It's the breakfast burger.
It's on the second page.

139
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,627
And the egg doesn't drip on your hands?

140
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,585
Nope, hash brown soaks it right up.

141
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:43,932
- Wow, that's thought out.
- Okay, all right.

142
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,394
- It's thought out.
- Okay.

143
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,333
Are we done with the burger talk?
Yes, sorry.

144
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,420
Are we done? Okay.

145
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:50,704
So I'm sorry, please. Continue.

146
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,115
Uh, no problem. Actually, this week...

147
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,614
I'm sorry.
I gotta stop... I gotta stop this.

148

You know what it is? I just...

I tried to go healthy, but it's just...
it's not workin'.

You know, I'm gonna start Monday.

152

I'll start Monday.
Hey, waitress? Can I get...

153
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,240
- Honey, honey, honey, honey.
- Huh?

154
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,365
You keep interrupting people,
and they're trying to tell us

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,513
where they're going for the weekend.

156
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:08,738
And I wanna hear all about it,
but I will hear much better

157
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,255
with the breakfast burger.

158
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,631
Two meals, one bun. I'll be locked on.

159
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:14,818
Okay, excuse me, waitress.

160
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,957
Could you fly in one of
these for my husband?

161
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:20,059
I'll pay you a million dollars.
Thanks so much. Okay. Sorry.

162
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,668
I like this guy.
You know what it is about him?

163
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:22,787
He's got an appetite for life.

164
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:25,114
Yes, life. That's what he's been eating.

165
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,739
So, you were saying where you
were going for the weekend.

166
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:31,864
Yeah, Boston. We're having
a big art show this weekend.

167
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:32,662
Oh, Boston.

168
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,223
It's gonna be kind of nice.
I thought maybe...

[Cellphone chiming]

170
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,138
Excuse me.

171
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:40,568
Oh. Give me one second.

172
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,349
What is it?

173
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:44,941
I thought you told me it was handled.

174
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:48,998
I'm sorry. We gotta run. It's business.

175
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,402

- No, no. Don't worry.

00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,896
- But I'll see you guys soon.
- Okay.

177
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,083
- Yes, you got it.
- All right, bye.

178
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:57,802
- All right.
- What is the matter with you?

179
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,247
What?

180
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,193
I am try...

181
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:04,484
I'm gonna eat around the bite marks.

182
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:09,058
No! I am trying to get information,

183
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,451
and you are yapping about your burger!

184
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,146
I'm trying to make things look natural.

185
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,623
- It's called police work.
- [Scoffs]

186
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:15,615
And what about you?

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,115
"Hey, can you tell us where
your crime is going down?

188
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,372
"And if you wouldn't mind,
speak into the tiny microphone

189
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:23,833
in my blouse. That'd
be super. I like it."

190
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,747
Come on.

191
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,685
- You got problems, you know that?
- Oh, I got problems?

192
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,510
Yeah. [Under breath] I told
you this was a bad idea.

193
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,419
It's a very good idea.
I got us the information we need.

194
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:38,890
All right,

195
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:39,841
- you have your own mic, stupid!
- Boston.

196
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:40,950
- It's Boston.
- Get over.

197
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,934
You know what else I got?

198
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,085
I got two burgers, I got a vanilla malt,

199
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,473
and a salad for my wife.

200
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:49,302
By the way,
we got a pretty big tab out here,

201
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,630
so if you can run out a debit card.

202
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,775
I scoped out your rezzie,
checked some refs,

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,405
noodled around on your app submish,

204
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,319
and I'm just gonna
come out and say it...

205
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:01,577
I want you here at Nozzler.

206
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:05,327
Uh, I appreciate that, Parker, but, uh,

207
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,309
- I am an entrepreneur myself...
- [Thud]

208
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:11,631
and I'm not sure that
I would be comfortable

209
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:14,264
being a spoke in a wheel.

210
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,756
My dream is to be the wheel.

211
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,248
Hear it, respect it.

212
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,366
In fact, you know who
said the same thing

213
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,857
about six months ago?

214
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,785
Little dreamer named Parker Cohen. Yeah.

215
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,741
And now I'm about to
take this baby public.

216
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,412
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

217
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:30,491
Yeah.
And that's when we decide to break open

218
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:32,108
this 50-year-old bottle of scotch.

219
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,028
I don't wanna tell you how much
I paid for it, but I'm gonna.

220
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,233
$27,000.

221
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:37,642
- Oh, wow.
- That is a lot of money.

222
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,966
Yes, it is.

223
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:40,631
So here's the offer.

224
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,390
Six figs, stock options,
piece of everything we develop,

225
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,959
plus...

226
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,272
we rent out Six Flags
for our company retreat.

227
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,964
[Exhales]

228
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:50,998
I do love the log flume.

229
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:55,303
And here,
a little cinnamon on your breadstick.

230
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,886
A signing bonus.

231
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:00,920
$10,000?

232
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,612
What do you say, Chale?

233
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:04,218
Wanna flume to the moon?

234
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,772
Hey, you know where my socks are?

235
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,608
Wow.

236
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,600
That is quite the statement.

237
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,291
Yeah, where, uh, where are my Met socks?

238
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:19,459
I need 'em for Fantasy Camp.

239
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:21,225
Why can't you just wear
the socks you have on?

240
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,296
That's a great idea.

241
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,459
So when they divide up teams down there,

242
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,319
they'll be like, "Okay,
uh, we'll take the dude"

243
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,483
"with the eye patch.

244
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:29,483
You can have the sad guy
with the regular socks."

245
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,087
That's cute that you think socks

246
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:35,327
are the reason you get picked last.

247
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:38,349
I've worked for 20
years for this moment.

248
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:40,014
- I wanna look the part.
- And you will,

249
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,178
but I need your opinion
on something first, okay?

250
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,194
- All right.
- Okay.

251
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,452
Pick my brain.

252
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:46,429
So I'm about to get
this promotion at work.

253
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:46,952
Uh-huh.

254
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,863
I know it. Everybody knows it.

255
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:49,998
But when they make the announcement,

256
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:53,147
I wanna, like, look surprised
and then humble, you know?

257
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,678
I've been working on it in the mirror.

258
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,647
So just tell me what
you think, all right?

259
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,471
Tell me I got the promotion.

260
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:01,305
"And the new... whatever the thing is

261
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,139
goes to... Donna Gable."

262
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:07,030
[Gasps] Wha...

263
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,688
Oh, my G...

264
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:11,912
- [Gasps] Oh.
- Okay.

265
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,632
Really?

266
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,162
Okay.

267
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,604
You gotta... you gotta
take it down a notch.

268
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:20,311
Really?

269
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:21,248
Your eyebrows, they're everything...

270
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,530
They're all over the place.

271
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:24,587
Okay, but I can't just
stand there like an idiot.

272
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:25,787
I gotta do something.

273
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,811
Just do what I do. I go from double guns

274
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:29,670
into prayer hands under the chin.

275
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,268
I do a face bow out into a point.

276
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,748
What's up?

277
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,983
I like that.

278
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,972
Yeah, whatever. Where
are my socks? Come on.

279
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,476
- Ooh, on top of the dryer.
- Oh. Great, thanks.

280
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,866
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah.

281
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,791
[Clicks tongue]

282
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,612
Hmm?

283
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:46,137
Mm.

284
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,608
[Door closes]

285
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,966
Hey!

286
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,937
Okay, so...

287
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,742
Not a good fit.

288
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,941
Oh. Well, that's okay.

289
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,398
- It was a great fit!
- [Laughs]

290
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:03,812
Do you see that? What I did there?

291
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:04,383
Yeah.

292
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,796
Okay. Stock options, a 6-figure salary,

293
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:12,741
and a signing bonus for $10,000.

294
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:15,437
- That is unbelievable.
- Right?!

295
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,835
- Mwah!
- Wow. Okay.

296
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,222
So this is amazing,
because I have news, too.

297
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,132
[Chuckles]

298
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:25,702
I got accepted to my dream school,
Columbia Law.

299
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:28,030
What?! That's fantastic!

300
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,094
It's way too expensive,
but it is really cool to know

301
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,108
that I got accepted.

302
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,479
No, no. Look, when Nozzler goes public,

303
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,137
money is no longer an issue.

304
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,879
We'll... and this is
gonna be the best part.

305
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:41,168
Seeing your father's face when
I give him this rent check.

306
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,933
Grab your phone. This is gonna be epic.

307
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,192
Yes! Donna, I got 'em! Awesome!

308
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:49,199
Mr. Gable, I present to you a rent check

309
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:51,237
for six months paid in full.

310
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:53,499
Thank you very much.

311
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,263
- To Fantasy Camp, huh?
- Yeah.

312
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:06,272
- Come on.
- Fantasy camp, baby.

313
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,697
- Whoo!
- Going to Mets Camp, are ya?

314
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,482
That's always been a dream of mine.

315
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:11,921
You know, I played Minor League ball.

316
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:13,062
I had no idea.

317
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,819
Yeah, yeah.
If you ever showed a little interest

318
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,273
in my personal life,
I probably would've told ya.

319
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:20,653
Uh, well, hey, have a great trip.

320
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,083
- Hey, Enzo.
- Yeah?

321
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,573
Wait a second.

322
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,934
This was supposed to
have meatball on it.

323
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,874
I just want to make sure.

324
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,735
Yeah, whatever.
You know what I'm talkin' about.

325
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,014
Whoa! Cellucci.

326
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,138
- What are you doing here?
- We gotta see Domingo again.

327
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:42,155
- What?
- Yes, at his apartment right now.

328
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,155
No, I can't.
We're going to Mets Fantasy Camp.

329
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,522
Oh, now you're just
twisting the knife now.

330
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,322
No, tonight we got the
"Good 'N Plenty Barbecue"

331
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,991
with Doc Gooden and then we
got drinks on the piazza.

332
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,018
Let me guess... With Mike Piazza?

333
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:56,359
No, Tim Teufel.

334
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:59,101
Look, this case is on the 1 yard line.

335
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,164
I just need you for one hour. Tops.

336
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,376
One hour, all right?
I'll meet you guys at JFK.

337
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,655
Kyle, grab my luggage.

338
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:09,283
Hey.

339
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:11,201
The massage is almost over.

340
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,907
Stella just has to crack my feet.

341
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:14,298
Gonna be a few minutes.

342
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:15,756
No problem, Domingo.

343
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,564
If you don't care of
your feet, who will?

344
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,806
- I love my feet.
- [Laughs]

345
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,483
- I'll be back.
- Yeah, good to know.

346
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:24,048
I like your feet.

347
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:25,987
[Lowered voice] What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

348
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,166
I got a flight to catch in an hour.

349
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,484
[Lowered voice] Okay. I'm sorry.

350
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:29,956
Why don't I just waltz in there

351
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:31,541
and tell a half-naked crime lord,

352
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,947
"Uh, my fake husband has to
get on a plane to Florida

353
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,962
to play grab-ass with
his stupid friends!"?

354
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,859
And some retired Mets.
There's a lot of people down there.

355
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,111
It's big event. It's a big event.

356
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:42,353
You're unbelievable, you know that?

357
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:44,306
You worm your way into my case
and now you wanna tell me,

358
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,376
- you wanna tell me...
- Whoa, wait a second.

359
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,845
- Wait a second. <i>Your</i> case?
- Yeah.

360
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,824
Okay... this is my case!

361
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,900
[Scoffs] I didn't worm
my way into anything.

362
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:53,325
Believe me,
they called me in here because <i>someone</i>

363
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,712
was droppin' the ball. Oh, yeah. You.

364
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,298
- Wow.
- Don't...

365
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,032
- Wow.
- No, no, no, don't you do it.

366
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,557
- Don't "wow"?
- Yeah, don't do... You don't "wow" me.

367
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:01,564
- Wow.
- You don't "wow" me.

368
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,126
- Wow.
- I "wow" you. I "wow"...

369
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:04,330
- Oh, you "wow" me?
- Yeah, yeah, I "wow" you.

370
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:05,712
You "wow" me? Well, listen!

371
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:08,189
I am <i>this close to solving this case.</i>

372
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,647
Don't screw it up.

373
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:11,157
Okay, okay,
can you lower your voice, please?

374
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:12,614
'Cause it is booming!

375
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,673
Shut... up!

376
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,892
The place could be bugged.

377
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,493
[Sighs]

378
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,751
No, look around, dummy.

379
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:23,877
I am looking. Look with your eyes!

380
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:24,233
Oh!

381
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,931
- That's how you look.
- Shut up!

382
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,006
Hey, I got it.

383
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,603
- The giraffe.
- Okay...

384
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,157
You don't say "giraffe."

385
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,681
You point to the
giraffe. You point to it.

386
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,706
- You just said it twice.
- Oh, my God! Just...

387
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,241
Check the stupid giraffe.

388
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:44,377
You said... That's
three times right there.

389
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:44,832
Okay, okay!

390
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,126
Fine! [Mutters]

391
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,383
Crap!

392
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,302
- Hey.
- Hey.

393
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:01,760
When did we get there?

394
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh, it's just a little
thing I picked up yesterday.

395
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,587
I know you enjoy the
occasional cappuccino

396
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:08,861
to put a little pep in your step.

397
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:13,963
Oh, Chale, you shouldn't have.
Those things are so expensive.

398
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,165
But since you did,
let's put some cinnamon

399
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,291
- in this mamma jamma, huh?
- [Chuckles]

400
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,583
Um, hey, babe.

401
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,486
Did you buy this for me?

402
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:25,751
Oh, uh, I'm not really good with purses.
Is that a good one?

403
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:29,454
Um, that's a Coach bag.
That's like 400 bucks.

404
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,197
Eh... Mm.

405
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,921
What?

406
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:36,400
Wow. I've been married 20 years

407
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:39,400
and I'm walking around with
an <i>Assistant</i> Coach bag.

408
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:42,309
Ah. I'm not familiar with that brand.

409
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:45,572
Kevin got it for me at the
Tri County Flea Market.

410
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:49,853
Um, he got that and my
<i>Alvin Klein</i> luggage.

411
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,798
Whoa. Wait, babe, there's $200 in here.

412
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,150
Huh?

413
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,236
Eh, I just wanted you
to have a good day.

414
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,900
- [Chuckles]
- [Gasps]

415
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,463
I feel like a mob wife.

416
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,329
In a good way.

417
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:06,032
Oh, Chale, you might wanna
pump the brakes a little bit.

418
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,658
Look, I'm just trying to show everyone

419
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:10,232
how much I appreciate them.

420
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,357
It's not... oh. I almost forgot.

421
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,848
Jackie!

422
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,824
- Yeah?
- Here's a few slices of cheddar

423
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,080
for you to get that video game.

424
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:22,165
I am diggin' rich Chale!

425
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,056
[Chale chuckles]

426
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,634
In this house, money buys affection.

427
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:29,540
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

428
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,502
What the hell did you do?

429
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,900
I barely touched it, all right?

430
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,830
- It was halfway falling off already.
- Well, then fix it!

431
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:37,220
Okay, let me just get out my
ceramic giraffe repair kit.

432
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:39,832
I need something sticky.

433
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:40,993
Give me some gum. Give me some gum.

434
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:42,295
I don't even think I have any.

435
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,431
Oh, please. You're from Massapequa.

436
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,876
Your name's Vanessa
Cellucci. You got gum.

437
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:48,923
Come on. Hurry up.

438
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,822
[Chewing rapidly]

439
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,403
What flavor is this?

440
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,039
[Mouth full] Passion bubble.

441
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:08,135
- Passion bubble? What are you, 12?
- [Groans]

442
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,243
Domingo: Be right out, guys!
Just putting on pants.

443
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,275
Oh, no rush!

444
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,100
- [Lowered voice] Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

445
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:16,900
Okay, give me...

446
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:18,498
Not enough. Give me
some more. Give me more.

447
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,049
It's not sticky enough. Come on.

448
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:22,086
Okay, just give me your gum.
Give me... oh, it's so gross.

449
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,332
- Oh, it's like a river in there.
- All right, shut up!

450
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:28,314
- Hey.
- Thank you so much for waiting.

451
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,814
[Singsongy] Who wants drinks?

452
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,056
Oh, you know what? I think we're good,

453
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:34,181
because we're in a bit of a time crunch,
so...

454
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,838
All right, well, let's get into it.

455
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:38,978
This weekend is our
biggest art show in Boston.

456
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,220
We thought maybe we could
do some business there.

457
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:43,259
We would... We would love that.

458
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:46,072
Perfect. So it's settled.
You're coming tomorrow. Boston.

459
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:49,001
Oh, snag. No, no, I mean, I
can't make it this weekend,

460
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,283
- but I think you can, right, hon?
- Yes, I can.

461
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:52,790
Oh, there you go. It's gonna be great.

462
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,715
And Boston's such an
awesome town, right?

463
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,197
[Boston accent] "Hey, Tommy,
did you touch Bobby's lobster?"

464
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:59,389
"I did not touch Bobby's lobster.

465
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:02,040
Bobby touched his own lobster."

466
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,531
[Laughs]

467
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:05,556
[Normal voice] It's a great city.

468
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,439
No, no, we'll all go together.
We'll make it a couples weekend.

469
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,478
Yes!

470
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:11,799
Oh, you know, I'd love to, Domingo.

471
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:13,790
But I gotta throw you a "no can do."

472
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:15,815
Uh, honey. [Chuckles]

473
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,275
I think the... the doctor can
look at that rash anytime.

474
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,025
Mm. That's not true,
because I called them

475
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,236
and they wouldn't move my appointment.

476
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:23,633
Mm.

477
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:24,611
And it's pretty irritating.

478
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:27,158
- Yeah, he can move the appointment.
- He can't.

479
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,572
- He'll be there.
- I'm not gonna be there

480
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:29,479
- He'll be there.
- So I'm not gonna make it.

481
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:30,621
- He's gonna be there.
- Sorry, I'm not gonna make it.

482
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,212
Sorry. I can't do it. Nope.

483
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:34,651
Not having you both there would
be a major disappointment.

484
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,620
You know what?

485
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,120
Maybe this isn't the right fit.

486
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,031
All right, you know what?

487
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,792
You won this, my little care bear.

488
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,464
You won this one.

489
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:52,657
She kicked the table. I saw her...

490
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:54,481
Why would you do that?

491
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,378
[Cellphone rings]

492
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:01,767
Oh, come on. Don't do this to me.

493
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,462
I don't wanna know what's
going on down there.

494
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:05,190
<i>Drinking beers with Mookie Wilson!</i>

495
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:06,948
<i>Mookie! Ahh! [Laughing]</i>

496
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,901
Oh, come on. That should be me!

497
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:10,192
<i>Hey, if it makes you feel any better,</i>

498
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:11,769
<i>I'm having a hell of a time. Enzo!</i>

499
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,769
- <i>Enzo!</i>
- Enzo's down there?!

500
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,804
<i>I taught Mike Piazza
how to make a calzone.</i>

501
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:18,378
<i>Tomorrow,
he's treating us all to spray tans.</i>

502
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,870
<i>- Except me. [Laughs]
- [Laughter]</i>

503
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:27,127
- Hey, babe. How you doin'?
- I'm missing everything.

504
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,503
Oh, yeah. But on the bright side,

505
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,448
you get to spend a night in Boston.

506
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:33,773
You could do your whole...

507
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,440
[Boston accent]
"Did you touch Tommy's lobster?" bit.

508
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,933
I already did it at
Domingo's. It crushed.

509
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,125
I got nothing to look forward to.

510
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,599
I tell you what I'm doing.
I'm going to Wahlburgers.

511
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,167
That's what's happening.

512
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:50,525
Hey, you know,
it's obvious that they need you

513
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,821
to solve this case.

514
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,152
Okay, that's not true.

515
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:56,048
Why else would they pull
a guy out of retirement

516
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:57,831
unless he's essential?

517
00:21:57,856 --> 00:21:59,323
You know...

518
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,995
You know, I do...

519
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,021
I have abilities that a lot
of the other guys, they...

520
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,394
They just don't have, and...

521
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,237
He's useless.

522
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:13,034
I'm actually the centerpiece
of this whole case.

523
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:16,925
Maybe we'll get lucky and
he'll get food poisoning.

524
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:21,440
Hey, maybe I'll even win a medal.

525
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:24,072
Some kind of like civilian
thing for coming in

526
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:25,540
at the last minute there.

527
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,741
Yeah, and you know what?
You would deserve it.

528
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:30,331
He is such a moron.

529
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:33,214
Donna, you married a good man.

530
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:38,700
Sometimes I lose sight of that.
Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:39,589
Mm. Ahh.
