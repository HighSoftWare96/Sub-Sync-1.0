I didn't tip it over.
I kept feeding it in there.

45
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,700
And then finally when it did,
the spring released,

46
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,021
and then the Doritos just got stuck

47
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,942

Well, actually, I can't get unemployment

because I've never had a job,
so in <i>your</i> face.

and it would be an amazing opportunity.

and make great money.

gotta be the right fit.

- Sure. And, Chale, sweetie,

trying to say for all of us

is you make it fit.

you just jam it in there. Yeah.

103

down and we're good.

106

Cellucci's on this case.

and you don't cash it in

I see the two patties,
but what's in between there?

132
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,850
Is that cheese or an egg?

133

Both. With two hash browns on top.

- Yeah.</i>

Um, sweetheart.
Domingo was about to tell us...

136
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,834
Now was that a special
order or did you just...

137
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,880
Did you order that off the menu?

138
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,599
It's the breakfast burger.
It's on the second page.

139
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:48,100
And the egg doesn't drip on your hands?

140
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,058
Nope, hash brown soaks it right up.

141
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,405
- Wow, that's thought out.
- Okay, all right.

142

- It's thought out.
- Okay.

143
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,806
Are we done with the burger talk?
Yes, sorry.

144
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:55,893
Are we done? Okay.

145
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,177
So I'm sorry, please. Continue.

146

Uh, no problem. Actually, this week...

it's not workin'.

I'll start Monday.
Hey, waitress? Can I get...

- Honey, honey, honey, honey.
- Huh?

You keep interrupting people,
and they're trying to tell us

155

where they're going for the weekend.

156
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,211
And I wanna hear all about it,
but I will hear much better

158
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,104
Two meals, one bun. I'll be locked on.

159
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,291
Okay, excuse me, waitress.

160
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,430
Could you fly in one of
these for my husband?

161
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:27,532
I'll pay you a million dollars.
Thanks so much. Okay. Sorry.

162
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,141
I like this guy.
You know what it is about him?

163
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,260
He's got an appetite for life.

164
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,587
Yes, life. That's what he's been eating.

165
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:37,212
So, you were saying where you
were going for the weekend.

166
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,337
Yeah, Boston. We're having
a big art show this weekend.

167
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,135
Oh, Boston.

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,696
It's gonna be kind of nice.

Oh. Give me one second.

What is it?

173
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,414
I thought you told me it was handled.

174
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:56,471

- No, no. Don't worry.

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,369
- But I'll see you guys soon.
- Okay.

177
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,556
- Yes, you got it.
- All right, bye.

178
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,275
- All right.
- What is the matter with you?

179
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,720
What?

180
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,666
I am try...

181
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,957
I'm gonna eat around the bite marks.

182
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:16,531
No! I am trying to get information,

183
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:18,924
and you are yapping about your burger!

184
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,619
I'm trying to make things look natural.

185
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,096
- It's called police work.
- [Scoffs]

186
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,088
And what about you?

187
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:25,588
"Hey, can you tell us where
your crime is going down?

188
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,845
"And if you wouldn't mind,
speak into the tiny microphone

189
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,306
in my blouse. That'd
be super. I like it."

190
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,220
Come on.

191
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,158
- You got problems, you know that?
- Oh, I got problems?

192
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,983
Yeah. [Under breath] I told
you this was a bad idea.

193
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,892
It's a very good idea.
I got us the information we need.

194
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:46,363
All right,

195
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,314
- you have your own mic, stupid!
- Boston.

196
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,423
- It's Boston.
- Get over.

197
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,407
You know what else I got?

198
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,558
I got two burgers, I got a vanilla malt,

199
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,946
and a salad for my wife.

200
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,775
By the way,
we got a pretty big tab out here,

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,103
so if you can run out a debit card.

202
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:03,248
I scoped out your rezzie,
checked some refs,

203
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,878
noodled around on your app submish,

204
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:06,792
and I'm just gonna
come out and say it...

205
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,050
I want you here at Nozzler.

206
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,800
Uh, I appreciate that, Parker, but, uh,

207
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:15,782
- I am an entrepreneur myself...
- [Thud]

208
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:19,104
and I'm not sure that
I would be comfortable

209
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,737
being a spoke in a wheel.

210
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,229
My dream is to be the wheel.

211
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,721
Hear it, respect it.

212
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:26,839
In fact, you know who
said the same thing

213
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:28,330
about six months ago?

214
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,258
Little dreamer named Parker Cohen. Yeah.

215
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,214
And now I'm about to
take this baby public.

216
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,885
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

217
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,964
Yeah.
And that's when we decide to break open

218
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,581
this 50-year-old bottle of scotch.

219
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,501
I don't wanna tell you how much
I paid for it, but I'm gonna.

220
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:42,706
$27,000.

221
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,115
- Oh, wow.
- That is a lot of money.

222
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,439
Yes, it is.

223
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:48,104
So here's the offer.

224
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,863
Six figs, stock options,
piece of everything we develop,

225
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,432
plus...

226
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,745
we rent out Six Flags
for our company retreat.

227
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,437
[Exhales]

228
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:58,471
I do love the log flume.

229
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:02,776
And here,
a little cinnamon on your breadstick.

230
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:05,359
A signing bonus.

231
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,393
$10,000?

232
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,085
What do you say, Chale?

233
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,691
Wanna flume to the moon?

234
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,245
Hey, you know where my socks are?

235
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,081
Wow.

236
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,073
That is quite the statement.

237
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,764
Yeah, where, uh, where are my Met socks?

238
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:26,932
I need 'em for Fantasy Camp.

239
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,698
Why can't you just wear
the socks you have on?

240
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:29,769
That's a great idea.

241
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:30,932
So when they divide up teams down there,

242
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,792
they'll be like, "Okay,
uh, we'll take the dude"

243
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:33,956
"with the eye patch.

244
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,956
You can have the sad guy
with the regular socks."

245
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,560
That's cute that you think socks

246
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,800
are the reason you get picked last.

247
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,822
I've worked for 20
years for this moment.

248
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,487
- I wanna look the part.
- And you will,

249
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,651
but I need your opinion
on something first, okay?

250
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:50,667
- All right.
- Okay.

251
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:51,925
Pick my brain.

252
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,902
So I'm about to get
this promotion at work.

253
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,425
Uh-huh.

254
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,336
I know it. Everybody knows it.

255
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,471
But when they make the announcement,

256
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,620
I wanna, like, look surprised
and then humble, you know?

257
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,151
I've been working on it in the mirror.

258
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,120
So just tell me what
you think, all right?

259
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,944
Tell me I got the promotion.

260
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,778
"And the new... whatever the thing is

261
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:12,612
goes to... Donna Gable."

262
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,503
[Gasps] Wha...

263
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,161
Oh, my G...

264
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:19,385
- [Gasps] Oh.
- Okay.

265
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,105
Really?

266
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,635
Okay.

267
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:27,077
You gotta... you gotta
take it down a notch.

268
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:27,784
Really?

269
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:28,721
Your eyebrows, they're everything...

270
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,003
They're all over the place.

271
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:32,060
Okay, but I can't just
stand there like an idiot.

272
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,260
I gotta do something.

273
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,284
Just do what I do. I go from double guns

274
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,143
into prayer hands under the chin.

275
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,741
I do a face bow out into a point.

276
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,221
What's up?

277
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:42,456
I like that.

278
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,445
Yeah, whatever. Where
are my socks? Come on.

279
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,949
- Ooh, on top of the dryer.
- Oh. Great, thanks.

280
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:47,339
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah.

281
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,264
[Clicks tongue]

282
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,085
Hmm?

283
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,610
Mm.

284
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:00,081
[Door closes]

285
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:01,439
Hey!

286
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:03,410
Okay, so...

287
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,215
Not a good fit.

288
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,414
Oh. Well, that's okay.

289
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,871
- It was a great fit!
- [Laughs]

290
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,285
Do you see that? What I did there?

291
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,856
Yeah.

292
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:15,269
Okay. Stock options, a 6-figure salary,

293
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:20,214
and a signing bonus for $10,000.

294
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,910
- That is unbelievable.
- Right?!

295
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:25,308
- Mwah!
- Wow. Okay.

296
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,695
So this is amazing,
because I have news, too.

297
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,605
[Chuckles]

298
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,175
I got accepted to my dream school,
Columbia Law.

299
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,503
What?! That's fantastic!

300
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,567
It's way too expensive,
but it is really cool to know

301
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:38,581
that I got accepted.

302
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,952
No, no. Look, when Nozzler goes public,

303
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,610
money is no longer an issue.

304
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,352
We'll... and this is
gonna be the best part.

305
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,641
Seeing your father's face when
I give him this rent check.

306
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,406
Grab your phone. This is gonna be epic.

307
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:53,665
Yes! Donna, I got 'em! Awesome!

308
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,672
Mr. Gable, I present to you a rent check

309
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:58,710
for six months paid in full.

310
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,972
Thank you very much.

311
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:12,736
- To Fantasy Camp, huh?
- Yeah.

312
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,745
- Come on.
- Fantasy camp, baby.

313
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,170
- Whoo!
- Going to Mets Camp, are ya?

314
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:17,955
That's always been a dream of mine.

315
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,394
You know, I played Minor League ball.

316
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,535
I had no idea.

317
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,292
Yeah, yeah.
If you ever showed a little interest

318
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:24,746
in my personal life,
I probably would've told ya.

319
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:28,126
Uh, well, hey, have a great trip.

320
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,556
- Hey, Enzo.
- Yeah?

321
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,046
Wait a second.

322
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,407
This was supposed to
have meatball on it.

323
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,347
I just want to make sure.

324
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:40,208
Yeah, whatever.
You know what I'm talkin' about.

325
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:44,487
Whoa! Cellucci.

326
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,611
- What are you doing here?
- We gotta see Domingo again.

327
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:49,628
- What?
- Yes, at his apartment right now.

328
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,628
No, I can't.
We're going to Mets Fantasy Camp.

329
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:54,995
Oh, now you're just
twisting the knife now.

330
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,795
No, tonight we got the
"Good 'N Plenty Barbecue"

331
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,464
with Doc Gooden and then we
got drinks on the piazza.

332
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,491
Let me guess... With Mike Piazza?

333
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,832
No, Tim Teufel.

334
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:06,574
Look, this case is on the 1 yard line.

335
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,637
I just need you for one hour. Tops.

336
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,849
One hour, all right?
I'll meet you guys at JFK.

337
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,128
Kyle, grab my luggage.

338
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:16,756
Hey.

339
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,674
The massage is almost over.

340
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,380
Stella just has to crack my feet.

341
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:21,771
Gonna be a few minutes.

342
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,229
No problem, Domingo.

343
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:26,037
If you don't care of
your feet, who will?

344
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,279
- I love my feet.
- [Laughs]

345
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:29,956
- I'll be back.
- Yeah, good to know.

346
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:31,521
I like your feet.

347
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,460
[Lowered voice] What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

348
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:34,639
I got a flight to catch in an hour.

349
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,957
[Lowered voice] Okay. I'm sorry.

350
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,429
Why don't I just waltz in there

351
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:39,014
and tell a half-naked crime lord,

352
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,420
"Uh, my fake husband has to
get on a plane to Florida

353
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,435
to play grab-ass with
his stupid friends!"?

354
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,332
And some retired Mets.
There's a lot of people down there.

355
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,584
It's big event. It's a big event.

356
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:49,826
You're unbelievable, you know that?

357
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:51,779
You worm your way into my case
and now you wanna tell me,

358
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:52,849
- you wanna tell me...
- Whoa, wait a second.

359
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,318
- Wait a second. <i>Your</i> case?
- Yeah.

360
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,297
Okay... this is my case!

361
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,373
[Scoffs] I didn't worm
my way into anything.

362
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,798
Believe me,
they called me in here because <i>someone</i>

363
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,185
was droppin' the ball. Oh, yeah. You.

364
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,771
- Wow.
- Don't...

365
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:06,505
- Wow.
- No, no, no, don't you do it.

366
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,030
- Don't "wow"?
- Yeah, don't do... You don't "wow" me.

367
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,037
- Wow.
- You don't "wow" me.

368
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,599
- Wow.
- I "wow" you. I "wow"...

369
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:11,803
- Oh, you "wow" me?
- Yeah, yeah, I "wow" you.

370
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,185
You "wow" me? Well, listen!

371
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,662
I am <i>this close to solving this case.</i>

372
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,120
Don't screw it up.

373
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:18,630
Okay, okay,
can you lower your voice, please?

374
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:20,087
'Cause it is booming!

375
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,146
Shut... up!

376
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,365
The place could be bugged.

377
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:26,966
[Sighs]

378
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,224
No, look around, dummy.

379
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,350
I am looking. Look with your eyes!

380
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:31,706
Oh!

381
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,404
- That's how you look.
- Shut up!

382
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:37,479
Hey, I got it.

383
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,076
- The giraffe.
- Okay...

384
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,630
You don't say "giraffe."

385
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,154
You point to the
giraffe. You point to it.

386
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,179
- You just said it twice.
- Oh, my God! Just...

387
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:50,714
Check the stupid giraffe.

388
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:51,850
You said... That's
three times right there.

389
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,305
Okay, okay!

390
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,599
Fine! [Mutters]

391
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,856
Crap!

392
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,775
- Hey.
- Hey.

393
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,233
When did we get there?

394
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:12,723
Oh, it's just a little
thing I picked up yesterday.

395
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:15,060
I know you enjoy the
occasional cappuccino

396
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,334
to put a little pep in your step.

397
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:21,436
Oh, Chale, you shouldn't have.
Those things are so expensive.

398
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,638
But since you did,
let's put some cinnamon

399
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,764
- in this mamma jamma, huh?
- [Chuckles]

400
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,056
Um, hey, babe.

401
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,959
Did you buy this for me?

402
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:33,224
Oh, uh, I'm not really good with purses.
Is that a good one?

403
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:36,927
Um, that's a Coach bag.
That's like 400 bucks.

404
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:38,670
Eh... Mm.

405
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,394
What?

406
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,873
Wow. I've been married 20 years

407
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:46,873
and I'm walking around with
an <i>Assistant</i> Coach bag.

408
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:49,782
Ah. I'm not familiar with that brand.

409
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:53,045
Kevin got it for me at the
Tri County Flea Market.

410
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:57,326
Um, he got that and my
<i>Alvin Klein</i> luggage.

411
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:02,271
Whoa. Wait, babe, there's $200 in here.

412
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,623
Huh?

413
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,709
Eh, I just wanted you
to have a good day.

414
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,373
- [Chuckles]
- [Gasps]

415
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,936
I feel like a mob wife.

416
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,802
In a good way.

417
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:13,505
Oh, Chale, you might wanna
pump the brakes a little bit.

418
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,131
Look, I'm just trying to show everyone

419
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,705
how much I appreciate them.

420
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,830
It's not... oh. I almost forgot.

421
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,321
Jackie!

422
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:25,297
- Yeah?
- Here's a few slices of cheddar

423
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,553
for you to get that video game.

424
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:29,638
I am diggin' rich Chale!

425
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,529
[Chale chuckles]

426
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:34,107
In this house, money buys affection.

427
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:37,013
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

428
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,975
What the hell did you do?

429
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,373
I barely touched it, all right?

430
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,303
- It was halfway falling off already.
- Well, then fix it!

431
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,693
Okay, let me just get out my
ceramic giraffe repair kit.

432
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,305
I need something sticky.

433
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,466
Give me some gum. Give me some gum.

434
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:49,768
I don't even think I have any.

435
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:50,904
Oh, please. You're from Massapequa.

436
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:53,349
Your name's Vanessa
Cellucci. You got gum.

437
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:56,396
Come on. Hurry up.

438
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:01,295
[Chewing rapidly]

439
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,876
What flavor is this?

440
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,512
[Mouth full] Passion bubble.

441
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,608
- Passion bubble? What are you, 12?
- [Groans]

442
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,716
Domingo: Be right out, guys!
Just putting on pants.

443
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:18,748
Oh, no rush!

444
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,573
- [Lowered voice] Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

445
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,373
Okay, give me...

446
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:25,971
Not enough. Give me
some more. Give me more.

447
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,522
It's not sticky enough. Come on.

448
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,559
Okay, just give me your gum.
Give me... oh, it's so gross.

449
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,805
- Oh, it's like a river in there.
- All right, shut up!

450
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,787
- Hey.
- Thank you so much for waiting.

451
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,287
[Singsongy] Who wants drinks?

452
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:39,529
Oh, you know what? I think we're good,

453
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:41,654
because we're in a bit of a time crunch,
so...

454
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,311
All right, well, let's get into it.

455
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:46,451
This weekend is our
biggest art show in Boston.

456
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:48,693
We thought maybe we could
do some business there.

457
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,732
We would... We would love that.

458
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:53,545
Perfect. So it's settled.
You're coming tomorrow. Boston.

459
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,474
Oh, snag. No, no, I mean, I
can't make it this weekend,

460
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,756
- but I think you can, right, hon?
- Yes, I can.

461
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:00,263
Oh, there you go. It's gonna be great.

462
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,188
And Boston's such an
awesome town, right?

463
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,670
[Boston accent] "Hey, Tommy,
did you touch Bobby's lobster?"

464
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,862
"I did not touch Bobby's lobster.

465
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,513
Bobby touched his own lobster."

466
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,004
[Laughs]

467
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,029
[Normal voice] It's a great city.

468
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,912
No, no, we'll all go together.
We'll make it a couples weekend.

469
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:16,951
Yes!

470
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,272
Oh, you know, I'd love to, Domingo.

471
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,263
But I gotta throw you a "no can do."

472
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,288
Uh, honey. [Chuckles]

473
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:26,748
I think the... the doctor can
look at that rash anytime.

474
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,498
Mm. That's not true,
because I called them

475
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:30,709
and they wouldn't move my appointment.

476
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,106
Mm.

477
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,084
And it's pretty irritating.

478
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:34,631
- Yeah, he can move the appointment.
- He can't.

479
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,045
- He'll be there.
- I'm not gonna be there

480
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,952
- He'll be there.
- So I'm not gonna make it.

481
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:38,094
- He's gonna be there.
- Sorry, I'm not gonna make it.

482
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,685
Sorry. I can't do it. Nope.

483
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,124
Not having you both there would
be a major disappointment.

484
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,093
You know what?

485
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:46,593
Maybe this isn't the right fit.

486
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:50,504
All right, you know what?

487
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,265
You won this, my little care bear.

488
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,937
You won this one.

489
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,130
She kicked the table. I saw her...

490
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,954
Why would you do that?

491
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,851
[Cellphone rings]

492
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,240
Oh, come on. Don't do this to me.

493
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,935
I don't wanna know what's
going on down there.

494
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,663
<i>Drinking beers with Mookie Wilson!</i>

495
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,421
<i>Mookie! Ahh! [Laughing]</i>

496
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,374
Oh, come on. That should be me!

497
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,665
<i>Hey, if it makes you feel any better,</i>

498
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,242
<i>I'm having a hell of a time. Enzo!</i>

499
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,242
- <i>Enzo!</i>
- Enzo's down there?!

500
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:23,277
<i>I taught Mike Piazza
how to make a calzone.</i>

501
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,851
<i>Tomorrow,
he's treating us all to spray tans.</i>

502
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:29,343
<i>- Except me. [Laughs]
- [Laughter]</i>

503
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,600
- Hey, babe. How you doin'?
- I'm missing everything.

504
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,976
Oh, yeah. But on the bright side,

505
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,921
you get to spend a night in Boston.

506
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,246
You could do your whole...

507
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,913
[Boston accent]
"Did you touch Tommy's lobster?" bit.

508
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,406
I already did it at
Domingo's. It crushed.

509
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:50,598
I got nothing to look forward to.

510
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,072
I tell you what I'm doing.
I'm going to Wahlburgers.

511
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:53,640
That's what's happening.

512
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:57,998
Hey, you know,
it's obvious that they need you

513
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,294
to solve this case.

514
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,625
Okay, that's not true.

515
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:03,521
Why else would they pull
a guy out of retirement

516
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:05,304
unless he's essential?

517
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,796
You know...

518
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,468
You know, I do...

519
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:12,494
I have abilities that a lot
of the other guys, they...

520
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:14,867
They just don't have, and...

521
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,710
He's useless.

522
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:20,507
I'm actually the centerpiece
of this whole case.

523
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:24,398
Maybe we'll get lucky and
he'll get food poisoning.

524
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,913
Hey, maybe I'll even win a medal.

525
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,545
Some kind of like civilian
thing for coming in

526
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,013
at the last minute there.

527
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,214
Yeah, and you know what?
You would deserve it.

528
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,804
He is such a moron.

529
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,687
Donna, you married a good man.

530
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:46,173
Sometimes I lose sight of that.
Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:47,062
Mm. Ahh.
